# ⚙️ Configuring the UBC Launch Pad Website

> ⚠️ This page is meant to be read from the [UBC Launch Pad Configuration Guide](https://ubclaunchpad.github.io/new/config)!

<br />

Most frequently updated website values (recruitment status, teams, etc.) on the [UBC Launch Pad website](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new) can be updated by changing the values in [`src/config.ts`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new/blob/master/src/config.ts). This site describes the different settings available and guidance on what each value should be.

To make an edit, simply edit the values in [`src/config.ts`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new/blob/master/src/config.ts) based on the guidance in the type documentation on this website and open a pull request in [`ubclaunchpad/new`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new). Rebuilding the website will then update the website using the configured values.

For more details on how to rebuild the website, or if something you want to change cannot be updated with `config.ts`, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detailed documentation.
