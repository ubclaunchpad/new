# ⚙️ Configuring the UBC Launch Pad Website

> ⚠️ This page is meant to be read from the [UBC Launch Pad Configuration Guide](https://ubclaunchpad.com/config)!

<br />

Most frequently updated website values (recruitment status, featured projects, etc.) on the [UBC Launch Pad website](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com) can be updated by changing the values in [`src/config.ts`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com/blob/master/src/config.ts), a configuration file written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). This site describes the different configuration options available and guidance on what each value should be.

To make a change, simply edit the values in [`src/config.ts`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com/blob/master/src/config.ts) based on the guidance in the type documentation on this website and open a pull request in [`ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com). Your changes will be automatically deployed when your pull request is accepted and merged!

If something you want to change that cannot be configured with `config.ts`, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detailed documentation on making changes to the website.

## Examples

### Configuring Recruitment Status

One example of an easily configurable component of the website is recruitment and applications information. To open applications for a new season, simply update [`recruitmentConfig`](#recruitmentconfig) with the appropriate values, for example:

```diff
- season: 'Fall 2019'
+ season: 'Spring 2020'
```

```diff
- applicationsOpen: false
+ applicationsOpen: true
```

More details are available in the [`recruitmentConfig` documentation](#recruitmentconfig).

### Adding a Custom Redirect

When preparing an event, you might want to be able to share `https://ubclaunchpad.com/my-amazing-event` as a nicer URL for people to access, which could then redirect them to another website. To add such a redirect, just add a new [`Redirect`](#redirect) to [`redirectsConfig`](#redirectsconfig):

```ts
{
  path: '/my-amazing-event',
  target: 'https://my-amazing-event-website.com',
}
```

Also refer to [USING.md](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.com/blob/master/USING.md#redirect-links) for more details. You can also check [`redirects.txt`](https://ubclaunchpad.com/redirects.txt) for a full list of currently active redirects.

### Updating Projects on the Website

Projects featured on the website are configured in [`clubConfig`](#clubconfig) under `clubConfig.currentProjects` and `clubConfig.featuredProjects`, which currently provides the projects in the "Teams" and "Past Projects" sections of the website respectively.

To make a change, simply add/remove/update one of the entries in `clubConfig.currentProjects` or `clubConfig.featuredProjects` - see the [`Project`](#project) type for more details.

## Providing Images

Many of the configuration options pertain to providing image assets through a URL (for the most part, avoid committing images to this repository to help prevent it from growing needlessly). When providing such an URL, make sure the provided link is a *direct* link to the image, i.e. instead of:

```
https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia/blob/master/.static/inertia-with-name.png
```

the link should look something like:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia/master/.static/inertia-with-name.png
```

On most browsers, you can get this link by right-clicking the image and selecting "Copy Image Location".

Be wary of the image size! Large images load slowly and can directly impact the experience of using the website.

Note that in some cases, if you use the gif or similar format, provided images *can* be animated, which looks pretty cool in the right situations!
