- [Anchor Links](#anchor-links)
- [Redirect Links](#redirect-links)

<br />

## Anchor Links

You can link directly to a section by using the section's name after a hash, for example:

```
https://ubclaunchpad.com#projects
```

<br />

## Redirect Links

The website automatically generates useful redirects such as:

```
https://ubclaunchpad.com/sponsorship -> redirects to current sponsorship package
https://ubclaunchpad.com/facebook    -> redirects to https://www.facebook.com/ubclaunchpad
https://ubclaunchpad.com/medium      -> redirects to https://medium.com/ubc-launch-pad-software-engineering-blog
```

See [`redirects.txt`](https://ubclaunchpad.com/redirects.txt) for a full list of currently active redirects. You can also add additional custom redirects as needed - see the [Website Configuration Guide](https://ubclaunchpad.com/config) for more details!
